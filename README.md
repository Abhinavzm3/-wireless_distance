Wireless Distance Measuring Device Using ESP8266

This project creates a wireless distance measuring system using an ESP8266 NodeMCU and an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04). The ESP8266 acts as a Wi-Fi access point and web server, allowing users to connect to it and view real-time distance measurements through a stylish, interactive web interface. It supports automatic updates, unit conversions (cm, m, in, ft), and alerts when the distance exceeds a set threshold. Additional features include data logging, pause/resume, and downloading logs in CSV format.
